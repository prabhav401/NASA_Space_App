## The Idea
To build a tool that works in a synchronised fashion with both NASA members on Earth and the astronauts.
this application will meet all the requirements presented in the problem statement and return values that adjust the persons sleep schedule dynamically to optimize it.
What we are doing :
* Taking flight travel details,daily work details from the smart watch as parameters for calculation , compare with optimal solution and return measures to overcome the deficit
* sending a compact smart speaker to space in each astronauts room that has:
    - aromatic essences to stimulate natural melatonin (Eg. Lavender)
    - an ML code that plays music according to mood of the user 
    - Verbal reminders to meet the lack of sleep needs 
    - positive messages , quotes 
* room temperature variation to let the astronaut feel cozy so that he can get a good sleep as many interviews said its somwtimes very cold 
* Take values provided by the Actiwatch as parameters and calculate to compare with the optimal solution and return messages that tell the candidate
    - what exercise to do 
    - what to eat 
    - how much sleep is needed , weather a nap should be taken or not 
    - when to rest
