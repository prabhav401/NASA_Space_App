## The Idea
Use the smart watch to retrieve the data from the astronaut, about his complete day and send this data to the space shuttle room.
Then using signals according to the mood of the astronaut (because of the complete working day) a variety of parameters will be varied:
* room temperature to let the astronaut feel cozy so that he can get a good sleep
* some light music from the room speakers according to the astronaut's wish
* aromatic essences to stimulate natural melatonin
